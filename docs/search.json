    "text": "Welcome to MATH3085/6143: Survival Models! MATH3085/6143 introduces the fundamental concepts and key issues in lifetime and time-to-event data analysis, with applications in areas such as actuarial practice, medical sciences, and demography.\nNote that MATH3085 and MATH6143 are double-badged. This means that the course content of the two modules is the same but some of the assessment differs.\n\n\n🧑‍🏫 Instructors\nThis module will be co-taught by\n\nDr André Amaral (a.v.ribeiro-amaral@soton.ac.uk): Chapters 1-9\nDr Chao Zheng (chao.zheng@southampton.ac.uk): Chapters 10-16\n\nFor any queries, please see either of us during our office hours\n\nDr André Amaral (weeks 1-6): Tuesday, 14:00–16:00, Room 54/10007.\nDr Chao Zheng (weeks 7-11 and 15): Tuesday, 14:00–16:00, Room 54/9001.\n\n\n\n\n📝 Assessment\nThe basic module assessment breakdown is\n\n30% data analysis project\n70% written exam\n\nThe data analysis project involves a series of tasks in which you will conduct survival analysis on provided datasets using R. The project will be released around mid-December 2025, and detailed instructions and guidance will be provided towards the end of the term.\n\n\n\n📖 Lecture Notes\nLecture notes are available in two formats:\n\nSkeleton notes: containing omissions corresponding to mathematical details.\nComplete notes: in which the previously omitted parts are included and highlighted in blue.\n\nStudents are encouraged to use whichever version of the notes they find most helpful to their learning.\n\n\n\n📒 Syllabus\nThe module content is structured into 16 chapters (with the corresponding slides updated throughout the term)\n\nIntroduction\nStatistical Models\nThe Survival Distribution\nDistributions for Survival Models\nSurvival models: parameter estimation \nNon-parametric Survival Estimation \nSurvival Regression Models \nMultistate Survival Models \nInference for Multistate Models \nModelling Human Lifetime\nThe Life Table and Life Expectancy\nInterpolating a Life Table\nLife Table Models\nExposure to Risk\nComparing Mortality Rates\nGraduation\n\nThese chapters can be divided into six parts (labelled A to F), each corresponding to a problem sheet.

    "text": "The statistical software package R will be used to model real survival data. To support your learning, we have created a set of self-paced tutorials. The tutorials includes quizzes and more substantial exercises. You do not need to start it until after you have studied Chapter 7.\nIf you are new to R or would like a refresher, we have also repurposed some self-paced R tutorials used in other modules. Instructions for installing R and RStudio on your own machine are available here, and the repurposed tutorials are available here.\nAdditionally, drop-in support sessions for R will be available. More details will be provided once the schedule is confirmed.\n\nThe self-paced tutorial can be accessed here (developed by Dr Antony Overstall)."
